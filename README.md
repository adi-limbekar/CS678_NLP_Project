CS678_NLP_Project

Prepared datasets: Prepared dataset can be found in ./data/original_dataset folder

Preprocessed competition dataset: Dataset was prepared by removing duplicates and transfer some examples from the dev set to the train set. Files are available in the ./data/preprocessed_dataset folder.

To run the code please follow the code sequence in the CS678_nlp.ipynb file.

You can view the entire workflow in the pdf file of the same CS678_nlp.ipynb file and the project report in ./Documents folder.

For the final results of eval.py please refer the .txt files in ./models folder.

As there are many output generated files that are more than 1.5 GB, cannot upload it here, so to view all the files, folders and outputs of the models please use this https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xD1ZIqHdatgu8BZr1nav5pFJeOkI8nOi?usp=sharing
